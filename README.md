## Equation Editing in a Mixed-Initiative User Interface

#### ABSTRACT
We present a mixed-initiative interface to a computer algebra system enabling user-guided manipulation of algebraic expressions, and compare it to a modified interface that enables onlyfully automatic transformations, finding that a mixed-initiative interface does not improve user performance on simple mathematical problems over an interface that enables only fully automatic transformations.

#### Interface Design
